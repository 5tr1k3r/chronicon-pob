todo add explanation text on hover on items: title attribute
todo highlight stats/items that affect specific calculated stats

Sections: attack speed, crit, tooltips, dps

Attack speed: attacks per second, frames per attack, attack time (character), attack time (wolf), what's required for next breakpoint (later)

where to hold data? probably json somewhere
should figure out formula for breakpoints or use values from the table?

todo add B, T for big numbers
todo add damage over time calculations (with bleed calc), how much dps changes in x time, total dmg dealt
