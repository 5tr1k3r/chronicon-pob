todo add explanation text on hover on items: title attribute
todo add limiting crit chance to 100% (see pw-generator index.html)
todo highlight stats/items that affect specific calculated stats

Sections: attack speed, crit, tooltips, dps
2 types of data: inputed and computed
Can compute the amount of wolves based on skill level and items
Bleed to do later

Attack speed: attacks per second, frames per attack, attack time (character), attack time (wolf), what's required for next breakpoint (later)
Crit: crit effect modifier
Tooltips: how many wolves, %dmg for wolves, %dmg for ice shard, dmg for ice shard (with range)
DPS: per one wolf, per all wolves
duno what to do with alpha yet, later

where to hold data? probably json somewhere
should figure out formula for breakpoints or use values from the table?
